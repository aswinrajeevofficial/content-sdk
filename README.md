This repository contains source code for all Sitecore Content SDK packages and templates to help you get started using Sitecore Content SDK.

@TODO: adjust for new versioning

## Getting started with Sitecore Content SDK

To develop a Sitecore Content SDK application, you need:

- An operating system supported by Node (Mac, Windows, Linux).
- Node. We recommend using the latest long-term support (LTS) release.

> To run a Sitecore Content SDK application in production or develop using Sitecore data you need to connect your application to a Sitecore XM Cloud instance.

### Getting started with the latest version of Sitecore Content SDK

To create a Sitecore Content SDK project in a terminal, run one of the following command and follow the prompts:

```
npx create-content-sdk-app
```

For more information check out our [Getting Started Guide](https://doc.sitecore.com/xmc/en/developers/content-sdk/creating-a-jss-app-for-xm-cloud.html).

- [Skills & capability index](Skills.md) - Capability groupings and Agent Skills (`.agents/skills/`); for overview and commands use [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md)

**Which AGENTS.md to use:** The root [AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md) applies when working in **this monorepo** (packages, yarn, scaffolding). For head applications (including empty starters) generated from our templates, use the AGENTS.md that ships with the head application — it is copied from the template when you run `create-content-sdk-app` and you can adapt it to your project as needed.
