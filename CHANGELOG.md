# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

Major versions of this project will include breaking changes in core packages and align with Sitecore seasonal releases though not strictly bound to them.

Our versioning strategy is as follows:

- Patch: no breaking changes (e.g. bug fixes, minor improvements)
- Minor: non-breaking feature additions – no breaking changes (e.g. new features, improvements)
- Major: new features + breaking changes (e.g. framework upgrades, major architectural changes, major features)

### 🛠 Breaking Changes

* Decouple `@sitecore-content-sdk/content` from `@sitecore-content-sdk/core` ([#351](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/351)([#383](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/383))):
  - See a detailed upgrade guide for migration instructions
* `[nextjs]` `[create-content-sdk-app]` Upgrade to Next.js 16 ([#334](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/334))([#343](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/343))([#353](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/353))
  - Next.js 16 is now required (minimum version `^16.0.0`)
  - `middleware.ts` renamed to `proxy.ts` with updated function signature
  - Removed deprecated `images.domains` usage (use `remotePatterns` instead)
* `[nextjs]` Expand SXA redirects logic with support for isLanguagePreserved flag. This provides an option to preserve current locale when target redirect URL does not have a locale prefix ([#305](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/305))
  - This changes the default redirects behavior out of the box.
    - Previously, `/da/source -> /target` rule would redirect to `/da/target` path when default locale is not `da`
    - Now, `/da/source -> /target` rule would redirect to `/target` path, using default locale, unless the `Shall language be preserved upon redirect?` checkbox is enabled in Redirect Map.
* Upgrade to Node.js 24.x ([#332](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/332))
* Remove deprecated api's ([#360](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/360]))
  - `sitecore.cli.config`: 
    - The `config` property is now required; a reference to `sitecore.config` must be provided.
    - Build-time functions defined in the build array no longer accept the scConfig argument in their constructor. However, the function implementation must receive scConfig, which is passed internally by the CLI command.
  - `renderEmptyPlaceholder` method of `PlaceholderComponent` has been removed; instead import `renderEmptyPlaceholder` from `react`/`next` package
  - `DesignLibrary` component now does not accept any props
  - `SitecoreProvider`'s `loadImportMap` is now required
* [react] [nextjs] Major revamp of components in the react package ([#371](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/371)):
  - `Placeholder` and `AppPlaceholder` components' prop `modifyComponentProps` has been removed. `passThroughComponentProps` prop has been added to fill the role of passing props to child components
  - `componentMap` and `loadImportMap` have been added to the context shared via `SitecoreProvider`
  - `useLoadImportMap`, `useComponentMap` HOCs have been removed. The Sitecore context data can be accessed via `useSitecore` hook.
  - `withSitecore`'s `updatePage` prop has been renamed to `setPage`. This HOC has also been marked deprecated, and will eventually be removed in favor of `useSitecore` hook.
  - Old `withPlaceholder` HOC implementation has been reworked into slot-like logic with server and client implementations. `withAppPlaceholder` can be used in server RSC context, and `withPlaceholder` in client one.
  - Other components and HOCs in `react` package were refactored and should not have an effect on end user apps.
* `[react]` Placeholder suspense causes longer JavaScript Scripting execution time ([#384](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/384))
  - The default value of `disableSuspense` property is set to `true` to avoid forcing Suspense usage across all components which could negatively impact performance metrics. Suspense can now be enabled explicitly when needed.

## 1.1.0

### 🎉 New Features & Improvements

* `[react]` `[core]` Unite capabilities of library | library-metadata with library-variant-generation modes. `isVariantGeneration` is honored only when `isDesignLibrary`(library | library-metadata) is true and `generation=variant` query string is passed to the editing render endpoint. ([#208](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/208))
* Add Cursor AI coding agent rules for consistent development patterns across the Content SDK repository ([#207](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/207))
* `[nextjs]` Support component-level data fetching in 404/500 pages ([#199](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/199))
* Migration from ESlint 8 -> ESLint 9 and introduction of the new Flat Config file ([#176](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/176))
* Code generation for Design Library enablers:
  - `[core]` `[nextjs]` Add import-map generation ([#157](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/157))([#167](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/167))([#170](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/170))([#171](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/171))([#175](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/175))([#177](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/177))([#187](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/187)) ([#221](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/221))

([#208](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/208)) ([#215](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/215))
- `[nextjs]` Optimization for editing render middleware: issue an internal server request for fetching page data during editing instead of doing temporary redirect ([#195](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/195)) ([#196](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/196))
  - added new environment variable `SITECORE_INTERNAL_EDITING_HOST_URL` - the internal host URL for the Next.js application, used for server-side requests for page rendering during editing
  - added a new setting in _sitecore.config_: _sitecoreInternalEditingHostUrl_. This setting allows you to define the internal host URL explicitly, overriding the corresponding environment variable.
  - if none of the above is set:
    - in XM Cloud environment server request will be issued to `http://localhost:3000`
    - in Vercel or Netlify scenarios, the host header of the incoming request will be used to make the internal request

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

* `[nextjs]` Preserve default locale in external absolute urls ([#201](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/201))
* `[react]` Custom properties are not applied to empty field in editing mode ([#200](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/200))

* `[core]` Duplicate dictionary requests in editing, preview, and design library modes ([#161](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/161))
  - `SitecoreClient.getPreview` and `SitecoreClient.getDesignLibraryData` no longer request dictionary data. `Page` type is not affected.
  - Updated `EditingService.fetchEditingData`:
    - Removed `siteName` parameter.
    - No longer requests and returns dictionary data.
- `[cli]` Code extraction extends XM Cloud Rendering Host build by several minutes ([#173](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/173))
- `[core]` Fix redirect regex processing to prevent over-escaping of question marks in regex patterns ([#174](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/174))

## 1.0.1

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- `[core]` `[nextjs]` Restore proper local connection fallback
  - Added fallback to `middleware.ts` file to enable local API connections in the absence of `contextId`. ([#178](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/178))([#180](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/180))

## 1.0.0

### 🎉 New Features & Improvements

- Design Library Early Access enablers:
  - `[core]` `[nextjs]` Integrated new _VariantGeneration_ mode ([#158](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/158))
  - `[nextjs]` Default static import-map ([#153](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/153))
  - `[cli]` Code Extraction ([#71](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/71))([#113](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/113))([#114](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/114))([#154](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/154))

### 🛠 Breaking Changes

- Refactored `SitecoreProvider` and enhanced `SitecoreClient` ([#158](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/158)):

  #### Reworked `SitecoreProvider` and Context

  - Refactored components that use `SitecoreProvider` and related utilities.
  - `SitecoreProvider` now accepts a `page` prop (`Page` type from `SitecoreClient`) instead of `layoutData`.
  - Context state updates:
    - `pageContext` → renamed to `page`. `page` represents `Page` interface.
    - `setContext` → renamed to `setPage`. The method updates the `page` state.
  - Removed `SitecoreProviderPageContext` interface.
    - Consumers should now access `page` via the `Page` interface.

  #### Updated `withSitecore` and `useSitecore` APIs

  - Updated naming for clarity and consistency:
    - `pageContext` → `page`
    - `updateContext` → `updatePage`

  #### Improvements to `SitecoreClient`

  - **Type cleanup and consistency**:

    - Removed `NextjsPage` interface.
    - All methods that generate page data now return a consistent `Page` object.
    - Properties `componentProps` and `notFound` are now part of the `SitecorePageProps` interface and are treated as optional.
    - `SitecorePageProps` now requires a standalone `page` field instead of merging all data into one props object.

  - **New `getErrorPage()` method**:

    - Replaces `getErrorPages()`, exposing only necessary data.
    - Introduces a new `ErrorPage` enum to select specific error types (e.g., `ErrorPage.NotFound`)

  - **New `PageMode` Type**

    - The `Page` type now includes a `mode` field of type `PageMode`, providing runtime context (e.g. editing, design library, preview).
    - Replaces older properties like `pageState`, `pageEditing`, `componentType`.

    ```ts
    mode: {
      isNormal: boolean;
      isPreview: boolean;
      isEditing: boolean;
      isDesignLibrary: boolean;
    }
    ```

  #### DesignLibrary Component

  - The `DesignLibrary` component no longer accepts a `layoutData` prop.
  - It now accesses `page` directly from `SitecoreProvider`.

- Refactor and simplify service names ([#133](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/133)):

  You will be affected by the following changes **only** if:

  - You are referencing Content SDK services directly rather than using the `SitecoreClient` methods.

  If you're using the `SitecoreClient` to access services, **no changes** are required.

  Service class and config names have been refactored for clarity and consistency:

  - Renamed:
    - `RestComponentLayoutService` → `ComponentLayoutService`
    - `RestComponentLayoutServiceConfig` → `ComponentLayoutServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLEditingService` → `EditingService`
    - `GraphQLEditingServiceConfig` → `EditingServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLDictionaryService` → `DictionaryService`
    - `GraphQLDictionaryServiceConfig` → `DictionaryServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLLayoutService` → `LayoutService`
    - `GraphQLLayoutServiceConfig` → `LayoutServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLPersonalizeService` → `PersonalizeService`
    - `GraphQLPersonalizeServiceConfig` → `PersonalizeServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLErrorPagesService` → `ErrorPagesService`
    - `GraphQLErrorPagesServiceConfig` → `ErrorPagesServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLRedirectsService` → `RedirectsService`
    - `GraphQLRedirectsServiceConfig` → `RedirectsServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLRobotsService` → `RobotsService`
    - `GraphQLRobotsServiceConfig` → `RobotsServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLSiteInfoService` → `SiteInfoService`
    - `GraphQLSiteInfoServiceConfig` → `SiteInfoServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLSitemapXmlService` → `SitemapXmlService`
    - `GraphQLSitemapXmlServiceConfig` → `SitemapXmlServiceConfig`
    - `GraphQLSitePathService` → `SitePathService`
    - `GraphQLSitePathServiceConfig` → `SitePathServiceConfig`
  - Removed `DictionaryService` interface

- `[core]` `[nextjs]` `[templates/nextjs]` Refactor site resolution logic across packages ([#141](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/141))([#155](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/155))
  - Removed `sites` parameter from `SitecoreClientInit` type
  - Removed `SiteResolver` dependency and `resolveSite()` from `SitecoreClient`
  - Removed support for passing a custom siteResolver to `SitecoreClient`
  - Updated `SitecoreClient` to construct the `Page` using `siteName` instead of the full `SiteInfo`.

- `[react]` `[nextjs]` Refactor `SitecoreContext` naming to `SitecoreProvider` ([95](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/95)):

  We've revisited and improved the `SitecoreContext` naming for clarity and consistency. This affects component names, types, hook, and HOC.

  #### Component Renames

  - Component:

    - `SitecoreContext` → `SitecoreProvider`

  - Properties:

    - `context` property renamed to `pageContext` to clarify that it holds **page-specific data** only

  - Interfaces:
    - `SitecoreContextValue` → `SitecoreProviderPageContext`
    - `SitecoreContextReactContext` → `SitecoreProviderReactContext`
    - `SitecoreContextState` → `SitecoreProviderState`
    - `SitecoreContextProps` → `SitecoreProviderProps`

  #### Hook and HOC Renames

  - Functions:

    - `withSitecoreContext` → `withSitecore`
    - `useSitecoreContext` → `useSitecore`

  - Properties:

    - `updateSitecoreContext` property -> `updateContext`
    - `sitecoreContext` property -> `pageContext`

  - Interfaces:
    - `WithSitecoreContextOptions` → `WithSitecoreOptions`
    - `WithSitecoreContextProps` → `WithSitecoreProps`
    - `WithSitecoreContextHocProps` → `WithSitecoreHocProps`

- `[nextjs]` Component-level `getServerSideProps` and `getStaticProps` methods have been replaced by a single `getComponentServerProps` method for simplicity.
  - In case a separate logic is needed depending on SSR/SSG context, an `isServerSidePropsContext` helper method from `@sitecore-content-sdk/nextjs/utils` can now be used.
- `[nextjs]` [DesignLibrary] Script is requested from production even when a custom Edge URL is set ([#98](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/98)):
  - The `EditingScripts` component doesn't accept `sitecoreEdgeUrl` property anymore.
  - The custom Edge URL is now accessed via the `api` property of the `SitecoreProvider` component.
- `[nextjs]` `defineCliConfig` import has been moved to `@sitecore-content-sdk/nextjs/config-cli` submodule ([#128](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/128)).
- `[core][nextjs][cli]` Re-introduce component map generation logic ([#124](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/124) [#139](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/139))
- `[create-content-sdk-app]` Remove SXA components and style files from default `nextjs` template ([#139](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/139))
- `[core]` `[nextjs]` `[templates/nextjs]` Environment variables' naming has been updated ([#143](https://github.com/Sitecore/content-sdk/pull/143))
  - `JSS_EDITING_SECRET` → `SITECORE_EDITING_SECRET`
  - `NEXT_PUBLIC_SITECORE_SITE_NAME` → `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_SITE_NAME`
  - `DISABLE_SSG_FETCH` → `GENERATE_STATIC_PATHS`
  - `disableStaticPaths` config property → `generateStaticPaths` (with inverted logic for clarity)

### 🐛 Bug Fixes
